# Spotifyghtclub
Simple script to use the Spotify Web API to automate some parts of playlist creation. Very stupid name.

Its main purpose is to take an existing multi-artist playlist, then generate a new playlist with different songs from those artists.
 
Very WIP.
 
## TODOs
* Make playlist generation iterable, i.e. once you've generated one new playlist, be able to generate a second non-overlapping playlist.
* Comprehensive code tidying.
* Handle auth tokens properly.
